Linux Recovery Console
=======================

This console is based on Fedora 12 Installation Media (2.6.31.5-127.fc12.i686)

It contains

 * bash
 * busybox
 * LVM & filesystem tools.

Efforts were made on PNP and DHCP(networking), thought not so sure it works as expected.

If your USB stick or network doesn't work, try to find the device name from lspci or lsusb and
load the kernel module manually.

udhcpc shall work out of box; it is actually invoked at the end of sysinit. 
The scripting hook is borrowed from FreeWRT.
